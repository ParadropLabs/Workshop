# Paradrop Workshop

## Prerequisites

In order to get the most out of the workshop, you should familiarize yourself with these materials during the week before the workshop.

### Docker

Paradrop uses Docker to run chutes in what are called "containers".  These containers include all of the chutes's dependencies and provide some isolation from other apps running on the same device but have lower overhead than virtual machines.

1. Start with [What is Docker?](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) for an overview.
2. Look through the [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) guide.  The most important section for the workshop is the one on [writing a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_four/).
3. Become familiar with the Docker [command line utility](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerizing/).  You will not be able to try these commands on your own computer unless you install Docker first.  However, you will have the chance to interact with Docker during the workshop, so it will help to be familiar with it.
4. (Optional) For the very motivated, there are three one-hour [instructional videos](https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training).

### Git

During the workshop, you will use git to collabortively develop chutes and deploy them to a Paradrop device.

1. Sign up for a github account if you do not have one.
2. If you have never used git before, some of the commands can be unintuitive or behave very differently from other version control systems.  Try out this 15-minute [tutorial](https://try.github.io).

## Starter Chutes

TODO: Make github projects for the example chutes (network test, seccam, parental control) and add the links here.  Groups should fork the starter project, add their own code, and launch it on their routers.
